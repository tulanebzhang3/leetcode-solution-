771. jewels and stones
You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  
Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.  
The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. 
Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

#1 use two loops to run search
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, J, S):
        count = 0 
        for i in S:
            for j in J:
                if i == j:
                    count+=1
        return count

#2 direct use string method count() 
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, J, S):
        count = 0 
        for i in J:
            count += S.count(i)
        return count
