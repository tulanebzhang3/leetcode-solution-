1108. Defanging an IP Address
Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address.  
A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]".

Solution:
#1 simply use python 3 function to run 
class Solution:
    def defangIPaddr(self, address):
        return address.replace('.','[.]')

#2 create a new list then use join method  of string to get a new string
class Solution:
    def defangIPaddr(self, address):
        newAddress = []
        for i in range(len(address)):
            if address[i] is '.':
                newAddress.append('[.]')
            else:
                newAddress.append(address[i])
        return ''.join(newAddress)

#3 by use a empty string method += to get a new string
class Solution:
    def defangIPaddr(self, address):
        newAddress = ''
        for i in range(len(address)):
            if address[i] is '.':
                newAddress += '[.]'
            else:
                newAddress += address[i]
        return newAddress
