561. Array Partition I
Given an array of 2n integers, your task is to group these integers into n pairs of integer, say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) which makes sum of min(ai, bi) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.


#1 this question is just let you sort the list, if you want sort it by your self, it is okâ€¦

class Solution:
    def arrayPairSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        n = len(nums)
        sum = 0
        for i in range (n):
            if i%2==0:
                sum = sum +nums[i]
        return sum
